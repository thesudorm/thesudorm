# 100 Days of Code: Day 1

For those that are not familiar with it, the 100 days of code challenge is an endeavor to write code for an hour a day for a hundred days straight. 
Each day, the person undergoing the challenge must also post about their challenge online in a public space.
This is usually done on something like Twitter, Instagram, etc. 
The idea is that this creates a sense of urgency and accountabilty, making it easier to stick with the challenge. 

Earlier this year, I attempted this challenge, but I didn't complete it. 
I made it to day 68.
Towards the end of the challenge, I started at my first job as a full time developer and studies as a part time MS student at my local university. 
I was pretty good at convincing myself that I was too busy to keep doing the challenge. 

Lately, I have been thinking a lot about my goals in both my personal life and in my career.
There are all of these things that I want to do and want to become, but I am not making too much progress towards those things.
The thing about goals is that you don't simply wake up one day able to do the things you wish you could.
These things come from the daily decision to pursue these goals.
One of my goals is to become a strong developer.
I do not know what this would exactly look like, since it is a rather broad statement.
Maybe I should take some time to think about what such a developer looks like and what they are able to do. 
I do know this, becoming a great developer takes practice.
I will not wake up years down the road and all of a sudden have the skills of a high caliber engineer.
It will take practice for me to do this, and I know that the 100 days of code is a way that I can jump start this journey.
I hope that by attempting this again that I can make active practice a daily habit.

So, what did I work on during my first day of this challenge? 
I have a personal website, but I'm not a huge fan of it. 
It is kinda just a weak portfolio site.
I want to revamp it to be a bloggin site that I can use to express myself. 
It can also be a good hub for me to post about my daily progress in this fresh attempt at this challenge. 
Today, I worked on the layout of the site, toying around with bootstrap and ejs templates.
I am not the best with CSS and boostrap, but I think I would be a much more rounded devloper if I had a better grasp of these tools.
I think I kinda have my prorities a little backwards though, because the site is not functional.
This post is my first entry for the new site but when I finish writing this post today, it won't be up on the site.
Tomorrow, I am hoping to have a super basic but working version of the site.

Rewriting this site will be my first big project. 
One of the things that I really struggled in during my previous challenge is that I jumped from project to project way too often. 
This was super detrimental to my growth as a developer, because when the projects started to become more complex and more problem-solving, I would ditch it for a shiny new project. 
This kept me from "going deep" into a project and I would just do very superficial coding in a lot of uncompleted projects.
My GitLab is a graveyard of attempted and abandonned projects. 
I want to focus on fewer projects and to work through the more complex parts of software.
