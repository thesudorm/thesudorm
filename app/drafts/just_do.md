Just recently, in the last six months or so, I have stumbled upon a site called Hacker News. 
e
It's super simple really.
Users can submit posts, usually in the form of blogs or news articles, and comment on them.
The discussion is my favorite part.
I'm a big believer in learning from the experience of others (but is is the internet, so you kinda have to take anything with a grain of salt.).

Recently, there was an [article](https://www.howitactuallyworks.com/archives/future_you_masturbation.html) posted titled *Future You Masturbation*.
It was rather short and I didn't think the anecdote was all that relevant.
What was really impactful to me was the [discussion that followed](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19356029).
The top comment is the experience of a user that had made a commitment to release *something* every two weeks for the year.
The something could be a piece of software, blog post, etc.
Even if it was not finished, he said he would release it.
There are a lot of other nuggets in there as well, but I really wanted to focus on this and the article.

I definitely am guilty of this sort of thinking.
I find myself daydreaming about how future me will be a great developer, more in shape, skilled guitarist and better husband.
I imagine all the hours that I would spend to achieve this and just how great it will be.
In reality, I come home from work, grunt hi to my wife, sit in my chair and watch Funimation for 4 hours.
These things that I imagine becoming won't just happen with time.
I actually have to work at these things.
Tomorrow, I am not going to wake up and suddenly have the ability to play *Through the Fire and Flames.*
These things take practice.

I know that I need to put the time in if I really want these things in my life. 
I have attempted the 100 Days of Code challenge a couple times now.
