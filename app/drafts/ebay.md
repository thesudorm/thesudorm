Like most people, I love to buy myself new things. My guilty pleasures tend to
be tech related purchases. Laptops, computer parts and mechanical keyboards to
name a few. These kinds of purchases can be super expensive however. Shopping
for a high quality laptop can easily net you over a thousand dollars. If you are
a keyboard snob like I am starting to be, you can spend hundreds on a good board
and key caps. Not only is buying new tech expensive but it also is tough on our
planet. Electronic waste is a huge problem.

To help combat these issues, I do my best to purchase used products on sites
like eBay. I am a huge believer in buying used if I can. Not only is it great
for my wallet, but it also helps out with the waste problem buy helping curb out
the demand for new products.
