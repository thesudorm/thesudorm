I am a big fan of buying premium items when it is something that I will use for
hours. I spend a lot of time sitting at a computer for both work and play.
Writing code, journaling, playing games, chatting with friends, etc. About a
year ago I bought my first premium mechanical keyboard and I LOVE it. I found a
really good deal with a used one on eBay for $90. It is a POK3R with Cherry
clear switches.
