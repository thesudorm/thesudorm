Why am I picking up writing? Growing up I loved to read books. Constantly, I
would take a book with me to read on the bus, in the car. Heck, I would even
take books into restaurants to read while my family waited on our orders. The
worlds that authors would create would mesmerize me for hours and I would not be
able to put the books down. 

My love for reading is what first brought me into writing of my own accord. I
wanted to create my own worlds that people could get lost in. I wrote
a handful of short stories as a kid, but I mostly stuck with writing
descriptions of scenic places. Stories were really hard to write. Unfortunately,
I would lose interest into writing as I started to grow older. Most of my
writing experience now is from occasionally journaling and writing essays for
school and college.

I want to get back into the habit of writing because I think it is one of the
most underrated skills today. Being a strong writer can help a person out in
many aspects of their life. Good writers can share knowledge more effectively to
other people. In my world of software development, good documentation is key
for me to do my job. I think good documentation is the most important thing that
programmers should do if they want someone to adopt the tools they are writing.
I won't use a tool if the documentation is old or confusing.

The most common job that I have been accomplishing with writing lately is for
self reflection. Pouring out your thoughts, hopes, dreams and aspirations into a
journal entry is a great way for a person to be mindful. It's similar to
going on an introspective adventure to help one discover what __REALLY__ makes
me tick. What am I afraid of? What do I want my life to look out in 5 years? Am
I happy? Sad? What do I want to change? What do I want to stay the same?

The goal of me doing this blogging challenge is to get me to practice these
skills more. Blogging for an audience is especially good practice for me to
articulate my thoughts into a coherent form that other people can understand.
The best thing about this challenge is that these blogs don't have to be
perfect. The focus is to just get writing out there. Just write! Sure, it's not
going to be stellar but I'm writing. I'm practicing. I'm crafting thoughts for
other people to read, critique, enjoy, etc. Besides, with me just starting, it's
not like that many people are going to read my crappy writing so it's good to
make mistakes now :) Cheers!
